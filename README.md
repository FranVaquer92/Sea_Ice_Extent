# Sea_Ice_Extent

We want to answer the question: Has there been a decrease in the amount of ice in the last years?

For that we will use the sea ice extent measurements (in millions of square km) from the National Snow & Ice Data Center.

We perform the following processing steps:

Read and clean the data.
Normalize the Sea Ice Extent (SIE) data and visualize its temporal trend.
Compute the SIE temporal trend as a simple linear regression (OLS) and quantitatively evaluate it.
Estimate the sea ice extent for 2025.
